This is the place where you can keep all your data visualization content for this module. It includes a [lectures folder](lectures/README.md) where you can add lecture material week by week and a [gallery folder](gallery/README.md) that provides useful examples of visualizations created with the _litvis_ platform we will be using throughout the module.

The [portfolio folder](portfolio/README.md) is the place where you can work on your weekly exercises and the coursework project. You should _stage_, _commit_ and _push_ the portfolio content to GitHub week by week to provide evidence of continuous engagement in the module.
